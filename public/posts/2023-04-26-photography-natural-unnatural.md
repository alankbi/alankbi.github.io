This series highlights the complex relationship between humans and nature, elevating 
it beyond a simple black and white lens. The photos featured show both the beautiful 
and the ugly, the thriving of one and the decay of the other, and the ups and downs 
of both forces, in isolation and in unison. This series provokes meaningful reflection 
into how we can be more conscientious with human progress and take actions to benefit 
all those who live on this shared planet.
