These images depict the complex relationship between humans and nature, elevating 
it beyond a simple black and white lens. The featured photos highlight both the beautiful 
and the ugly, the thriving of one and the decay of the other, and the consequences, both 
good and bad, when the two forces clash. This series aims to provoke meaningful reflection 
into how we can be more conscientious with human progress and take actions to benefit 
all that live on this planet.
